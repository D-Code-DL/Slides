					<h2>Why Did We Decide to Do This?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>We were already interested in community outreach.</h3>
				<aside class="notes"> (B) We had been visiting city and metro area schools
					to speak with groups of students about what we did as app developers.
				</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>We saw a need.</h3>
				<aside class="notes"> -(K) students asked if DL had internships, answer was
					no <br />
					-we could only point them to resources and hope they figured it out <br />
					-knew that their peers from wealthier backgrounds could access people,
					AP courses, clubs, etc <br />
					-(B) there was an obvious lack of black role models in technical fields
					 available in the tech community at large, but specifically
					 inside the walls of local schools.
				</aside>

				<section>
				<h3>We were familiar with teaching.</h3>

					<h2>What Has Been Easy? Difficult? Fun?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Remembering the resource gap and checking our privilege--difficult.</h3>
				<aside class="notes"> (B) not everyone has a computer they can tinker on at
					 home, so you need paper-friendly resources as well.
				</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Forming relationships with the students--easy...</h3>
				<img src="../presentation-images/selfconf2016/20160516_brandyandstudents.jpg" width="800px" height="600px">
				<aside class="notes"> (K) Easy because we laid a good foundation by
					 dedicating the first two sessions to getting to know each other and
					 setting clear expectations.<br />
					 This included:<br />
					 -playing a game to introduce ourselves to one another (which the two
					 of us used JavaScript to make)<br />
					 -creating a team agreement all together, complete with norms we decided
					 on together<br />
					 -having a teacher they already trusted to be around at the beginning<br />
					 (B) (adds more of her insight)
				</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Keeping the lessons engaging, and trying to teach to multiple
					learning styles--difficult.</h3>
				<aside class="notes"> (K) The students gave us new ideas throughout the class,
					though, as well as through a survey we sent out at the halfway point of
					the program.
				</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>The challenge of keeping up with the students' growth and development
					--fun.</h3>
				<aside class="notes"> (B) It made us better teachers, as well as better students.
				</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Scheduling--difficult.</h3>
				<aside class="notes"> (K) Things always change at schools, and people are busy:
					IB presentations, state testing that ends up needing to
					 be redone. Also, we had our own crises come up at work at different
					 times,sometimes needed to split our attention...or one or the other
					 of us would be sick or traveling. It was important to be clear with students that
					 this would be the case.
				</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Watching the students light up when their code works--fun.</h3>
				<img src="../presentation-images/selfconf2016/20160516_students.jpg">
				<aside class="notes">
					-(B) A personal highlight of Brandy's. Helping someone to "getting it" has
					been very fulfilling.

			<h3>(Ironically enough...)</h3>
			<img src="../presentation-images/selfconf2016/smartphones.jpg"
			class="fragment" width="550px" height="309px">
			<aside class="notes">(K) The kids who have smartphones use them for a lot
				more than we did or even do now. For many, it's the main way that they
				 view the slides we send out and do research...
				 the computer is almost just for typing code.

			<section>
			<img src="../presentation-images/selfconf2016/empty_classroom.jpg"
			width="640px" height="426px">
			<aside class="notes">(B) Those involved in coding are involved in many other
				 things, so attendance was not always 100%; had to be ready to send
				  out whatever the lesson was, and to keep referencing those lessons
					 (integrating review into lesson, instead of stopping to review).

			<section>
				<h2>Re: Organization</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Get the academic calendar with all academic/extracurricular days</li>
					<li>A stronger system for keeping track of your own files</li>
					<li>Creating more integrated lessons that incorporated more soft skills
						 from the beginning.</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">(B) Academic calendar--so we could have planned for
					testing/mid-terms/finals and ceremonies/celebrations as well as
					vacations/days out.<br />
					File system--students switched computers a lot, or would forget flash drives<br />
					(K) Integrated lessons--coding skills are not enough, they need to know what
					being a coder is really like and what abilities are valuable in the industry
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Re: Engagement</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Create more out of class lessons to be delivered via email/text
						 messaging</li>
					<li>Use of more hands-on student-led activities</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">(K) Out of class lessons -- keep engagement high between sessions. <br />
					Hands-on activities--We'd want them to have to research
					to complete the tasks vs following our examples. The students should be
					driving their learning as often as possible. <br />
					(B) When students do their own research, they go far beyond what we would have covered ("5 minutes of struggle")
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Re: Efficiency</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Have students take an entry survey</li>
					<li>Develop on codepen.io (or something similar) from the beginning</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">Survey: to create a baseline we could properly
					measure their development (in skill and interest) from <br />
					Codepen: so you can see how everything works together without the
					saving and loading, etc. Eventually we'd teach them that, but we could
					save the complication at the beginning
